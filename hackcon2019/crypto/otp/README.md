hackerman is so dank that he decided to play around with OTPs.
he did the following:
message1 ^ key = cipher1
message2 ^ key = cipher2

He gives you cipher1 and cipher2 and challenges you to find the concatenation of messages 1 and 2.
Are you dank enough to find this?
Oh and also, 'meme' is so popular that hackerman used the word in both his messages.
cipher1 is '\x05F\x17\x12\x14\x18\x01\x0c\x0b4'
cipher2 is '>\x1f\x00\x14\n\x08\x07Q\n\x0e'
Both without quotes
